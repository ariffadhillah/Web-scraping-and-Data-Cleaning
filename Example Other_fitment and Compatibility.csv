,,,,https://automotivesuperstore.com.au/superpro-spf4660k,SPF4660K,SuperPro SPF4660K Steering Bush Kit,,"Rubber steering rack mount bushes fitted to vehicles from the factory serve two functions. Firstly, they are effective at substantially reducing the transfer of road noise and vibration from the cross member into the rack, up the steering column into the wheel. They also provide some tolerance for misalignment of the mounting locations.
SuperPro offer a range of replacement steering rack mounting bushes for a wide cross section of vehicle. These steering rack mounting bushes are made of high-quality polyurethane elastomer, which offer several advantages over standard rubber alternatives.
While conventional rubber bushes do offer exceptional noise and vibration isolation properties and are cheap to mass produce, the rubber is so soft it can be compressed in on itself. This compression creates micro tears that propagate over time and causes the rubber to deteriorate. Polyurethane elastomer bushes on the other hand, while engineered to offer similar sound and vibration isolation properties, can move and flex but not compress or deform like rubber. This results in an improved driving experience through more direct steering feel, sharper and more responsive handling as well as substantially longer service life.
