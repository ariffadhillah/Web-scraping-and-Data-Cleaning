FMTBINL1,Forge Motorsport Throttle Body Inlet Pipes for Alfa Romeo Giulia / Stelvio QV,"After numerous requests Forge Motorsport are proud to offer two high performance replacement throttle body inlet pipes for the Alfa Romeo Giulia/Stelvio QV, this is an area on the vehicle which seems to fail after tuning. We have heard of cases from some of our dealers that the OEM plastic pipe starts to split under increased boost pressure.
With our experience and expertise in this area Forge Motorsport has produced a far superior solution for these failing parts. Designed and developed by our highly skilled team on the Solidworks CAD system, the turbo adaptor machined from a single billet perfectly fits the Alfa Romeo?? throttle body. Finished with our gloss black anodized finish to prevent oxidization and give it a quality OEM look, we have also incorporated?? 2 x 1/8th"" NPT water meth bosses into the design for tuners to keep the inlet air temperatures on the safe side while pushing the engine to its limits and aiding the option for a maximum power output.
??
The Forge Motorsport silicone hoses have an increase in diameter which allows for a greater air flow which in turn maximizes the volume of air being forced into the engine. This has the benefit of improving both performance and efficiency especially on vehicles running aftermarket software. However, it?? the structural benefit which is the main reason this product is essential, the multi-ply silicone doesn?? only take more boost load but will last the life of the vehicle which is why we give this product a lifetime guarantee.
Key Facts:

Manufactured from??6082??aerospace grade aluminium
Black anodised for ultimate protection and durability
No engine check lights (EML)
Increased air flow over stock item
The Forge silicone hoses in this kit have been designed to include a specialist??inner liner of modified silicone known as??Fluorosilicone.
This means the hoses are suitable to be used with??either modern long-life coolants, Organic Acid Technology coolants (O.A.T.) or air containing oil mist.
The construction of the hoses has been engineered to exceed that of the OEM fitments, and will enhance any engine bay both technically and aesthetically

PP1895PLUS,Pipercross Car Panel Filter PP1895PLUS,"Pipercross plus has improved strength and rigidity, swapping out the mesh used in the regular Pipercross panel filters and replacing it with a stronger and better looking 1mm steel frame.??
You can really feel the difference that this change makes to the strength of the filter, even when pulling 100?? of CFM (cubic feet per minute) through the foam.
The Pipercross Plus filter utilises two foams, the 20 PPI Foam and 60 PPI Foam.??
The 20 PPI Foam is a free-flowing foam that captures the large dirtparticles in an optimised thickness of 20mm, this first layer provides a great balance between filtration and flow.??
The 60 PPI Foam is a 5mm laye that is used to filter out any finer particles that make their way through the more open foam, this layer is mostly for protection, by keeping its thickness to a minimum it doesn?? disrupt the great flow of air this filter allows.
A new stronger frame has been created with breath ability in mind, when compared to our regular mesh,??this frame has a 22.1% increase in effective flow area.??Not only is this good in terms of performance, but the increased rigidity in the frame will also improve durability.

FMKT029-Red + PP2041,Silicone Inlet Hoses & Filter for Audi RS6/RS7 C8,"Forge are proud to release these pair of inlet hoses for the Audi RS6/RS7 C8. With maximum flow in mind, the factory ribbed hoses can impair flow characteristics in??the engines' turbos along with the potential to collapse from extreme vacuum that can be experienced on tuned and re-chipped engines.
With the OEM hoses also being made from a ridged plastic, they may degrade and split over a prolonged period of time. Our engineers have removed the ribs to aid with flow along with slightly increasing capacity, covered by our limited lifetime warranty; using only the best materials available, the Forge inlet hoses will long outlast the OEM counterpart and along with improving aesthetics, you can be sure these hoses will not let you down.

The Forge silicone hoses in this kit have been designed to include an expensive inner liner of modified silicone known as Fluorosilicone.
This means the hoses are suitable to be used with?? either modern long-life coolants, Organic Acid Technology coolants (O.A.T.) or air containing oil mist.
The construction of the hoses has been engineered to exceed that of the OEM fitments, and will enhance any engine bay both technically and aesthetically
The use of a Fluorosilicone liner ensures that Forge silicone hoses are the clear market leader.

PP2043PLUS,Pipercross Car Panel Filter PP2043PLUS,"Pipercross plus has improved strength and rigidity, swapping out the mesh used in the regular Pipercross panel filters and replacing it with a stronger and better looking 1mm steel frame.??
You can really feel the difference that this change makes to the strength of the filter, even when pulling 100?? of CFM (cubic feet per minute) through the foam.
The Pipercross Plus filter utilises two foams, the 20 PPI Foam and 60 PPI Foam.??
The 20 PPI Foam is a free-flowing foam that captures the large dirtparticles in an optimised thickness of 20mm, this first layer provides a great balance between filtration and flow.??
The 60 PPI Foam is a 5mm laye that is used to filter out any finer particles that make their way through the more open foam, this layer is mostly for protection, by keeping its thickness to a minimum it doesn?? disrupt the great flow of air this filter allows.
A new stronger frame has been created with breath ability in mind, when compared to our regular mesh,??this frame has a 22.1% increase in effective flow area.??Not only is this good in terms of performance, but the increased rigidity in the frame will also improve durability.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0247/5225/9121/products/pp2043plus_f0f6a2b1-74fc-45ff-85cf-abe0b9911599_2048x.jpg?v=1667403780,209.99,,Pipercross,PP2043PLUS,,,,,,,

Powered by Pipercross, The Pipercross cone filter will maximise the air flow which will help provide more power whilst maintaing clean & safe air for your engine using Pipercross's Performance foam compound.
The V1 is the optimal product to increase your air flow, perfect for anyone looking to gain more horsepower. The Pipercross V1 will always see more gains when partnered with supporting modifications and an ECU Remap, but will work well on it's own.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0247/5225/9121/products/BLANK_39dae86e-3928-4e20-a8a8-26c7b6863cee_2048x.jpg?v=1574077910,185.87,,Pipercross,VF344,,,,,,,
